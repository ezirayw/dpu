Cross Contamination Study:

Goal: Examine potential sources of cross contamination during influx:efflux events in continuous culture.

Setup: Innoculate every other vial in a checkerboard pattern to 0.01 OD600. Pattern will look like the following:

Strains:
0 (no cells)
1 (no growth on -LEU)
2 (no growth on -TRP)

Pattern (ensures no neighboring vials with same culture conditions):

0 1 2 0 1 2
1 2 0 1 2 0
2 0 1 2 0 1

Media: SDC +Glu +Adenine +Hygro

Chemostat: 0.17/hr dilution rate

Volume: 6.5mL


How: In between vial dilutions, arm will undergo wash steps with 70% ethanol. Wash step will consist of dipping arm into vial for 1min and air-drying
for 15 seconds before moving to next vial.  OD rises above background to ~0.1-0.3
